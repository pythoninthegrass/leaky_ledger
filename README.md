# Leaky Ledger

Leaky Ledger is a fake bank application that is meant to be hacked for educational purposes.

You can [visit this guide](https://circumeo.io/blog/entry/hacking-the-leaky-ledger-bank/) to reveal the vulnerabilities present in version 1.0 of the Leaky Ledger app.

## Quickstart
### Run via VSCode
* [Command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (‚áß‚åòP) > Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
* F5 for debug
    * May need to select interpreter (e.g., `/opt/venv/bin/python`) first

### Run via Docker
```bash
# build docker image and start containers
docker-compose up -d --build

# exec into container
docker exec -it leaky-ledger bash

# stop containers
docker-compose stop

# tear down containers, volumes, networks
docker-compose down
```

### Run manually
```bash
# create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# start web server
./startup.sh
```
* **NOTE**
  * ~~Won't serve images without reverse proxy~~
  * ~~And/or hacking Django `settings.py`~~
  * Appears to hydrate after a first run from docker
    * Could be a local issue ü§î

### Both
* Open [localhost](localhost:8000)

## TODO
* [Issues](https://github.com/pythoninthegrass/leaky_ledger/issues)
* Add more documentation
  * asdf
  * poetry
* Test devcontainer
* CI/CD
  * Terraform ‚ù§Ô∏è
